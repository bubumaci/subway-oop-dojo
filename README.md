We would like to create the management system of the orders in a restaurant. Our restaurant only sells two kinds of items, Sandwiches and Drinks. 
Maintain a list of the ordered items and their prices. 
A drink has a fixed price based on it's flavour.
A sandwich's price is the sum of it's ingredients' prices.

## Restaurant 
- list of all ordered items
- adding new orders to the restaurant
- calculating price of all orders in restaurant
  
## OrderItem 
- price of the item

## Drink 
- flavour (CocaCola, Fanta, IceTea)

## Sandwich 
- list of ingredients

## Ingredient 
- name
- price
